# Grocer.ly
Grocer.ly needs an ASP.NET developer with your skillset to help them build a new online shop.

You’ll be building a Razor Pages app that displays each item in their store, complete with images, names, and prices. Each item will have its own “Details” page.

You’ll be using Page Models, routing, and Razor syntax to make their vision a reality.

As you go through the tasks, make sure to Save your code to check that it compiles.
